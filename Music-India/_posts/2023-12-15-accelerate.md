### Metrics
- **Deployment frequency**: How often does your team deploy?

- **Lead time for changes**: How much time exists between a customer submitting a request and that request being fulfilled in production?

- **Mean time to recovery (MTTR)**: How much time does it take to recover from system failure?

- **Change failure rate (CFR)**: How often do you need to revert your changes?

<br />
“It’s much easier to make sure that the people building the software are doing the right thing than inspect nearly completed systems and features to find significant architectural problems and defects that involve a substantial rework.”

<br />
### In order to reduce deployment pain, we should:
1. Build systems that are designed to be deployed easily into multiple environments, can detect and tolerate failures in their environments, and can have various components of the system updated independently.

2. Ensure that the state of production systems can be reproduced (with the exception of production data) in an automated fashion from information in version control

3. Build intelligence into the application and the platform so that the deployment process can be as simple as possible.
