title: SOLID Design Principles
---

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
	- Every software component should have one and only one reason to change - Uncle Bob
	- Every software component should have one and only one responsibility
		- Component can be a class, method, or module
  - Cohesion and Coupling - High Cohesion, Low Coupling helps attain better adherence to the SRP
    - Cohesion is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are relate
    - Coupling is defined as the level of inter dependency between various software components
- **Open-Closed Principle** - Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program
- **Interface Segregation Principle** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
- **Dependency Injection Principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
